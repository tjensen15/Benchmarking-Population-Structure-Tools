# Benchmarking-Population-Structure-Tools

For my Advanced Bioinformatics semester project I am benchmarking three population structure tools: PLINK2, ADMIXTURE, and VCF2PCACluster. My main goal is to see which tool is better for population structure and clustering. Each tool uses a different approach and has other functionalities attached to it. I want to understand if there are any tradeoffs between basic analysis and additional functionalities and if those extra functions are worth the added run time/memory usage. This project is still a work in progress, but will be updated once it is completed.
